SpringRestfulAPI_Simplified
CRUD represents Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, and Delete – fundamental actions on persistent storage, aligned with HTTP methods used in web development and database management:

– POST: Establishes a fresh resource.

– GET: Retrieves/reads a resource.

– PUT: Modifies an existing resource.

– DELETE: Removes a resource.

As the name suggests:

CREATE Operation: Enacts the INSERT statement to create a new record.

READ Operation: Retrieves table entries determined by the provided input parameter.

UPDATE Operation: Executes an update statement on the table, based on the input parameter.

DELETE Operation: Removes a designated row from the table, also depending upon the input parameter.

Method = POST(JSON Format) Operation  || Create Customer

Method = PUT(JSON format) Operation || Update Customer

Method = GET(JSON Format) Operation || Get Customer's

Method = POST(JSON Format) Operation  || Post Transaction

Method = DELETE(JSON Format) Operation || Delete Customer

What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring, including all its features. It’s popular among developers because it offers a quick production-ready setup, allowing them to concentrate on coding instead of dealing with configurations. With its microservice approach, creating production-ready applications is fast and easy.

What is MySQL Database?
MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. It efficiently stores and retrieves data for software applications, websites, and more. Known for its reliability and speed, MySQL supports various data types, transactions, and complex queries. It offers both client-server and embedded modes, allowing it to be integrated into different setups. With a large user community and extensive documentation, MySQL is a popular choice for businesses and developers seeking a robust and scalable database solution.

What is REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that enable different software applications to communicate and interact over the Internet. It follows the principles of REST, using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources such as data or services. REST APIs use URLs to identify resources and return data in formats like JSON or XML. This architecture promotes scalability, modularity, and simplicity, allowing diverse systems to work together seamlessly. REST APIs are widely used for building web services, mobile apps, and other distributed software applications.
